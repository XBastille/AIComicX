It seems like the input provided is not a narrative or dialogue-driven story but rather a detailed description of features, rules, and requirements for designing an e-learning platform. This type of content does not lend itself to being converted into a comic book format, as it lacks characters, dialogue, and a narrative structure typically required for such adaptation.

If you have a story, plot, or character-driven text that you'd like converted into a comic book format, please provide that, and Iâ€™ll be happy to assist!
