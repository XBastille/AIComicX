Error: File 'Sure thing! Here's a comedic comic story about Ayush and Arpit, where Ayush is bullied by Arpit.

---

In the small, chaotic town of Lucknow, Ayush, a clumsy but lovable teenager, is known for his misadventures. He's always got a smile on his face, even when he's the target of Arpit's pranks. Arpit, the school's self-proclaimed 'king of comedy', thinks he's hilarious. Unfortunately, his humor often comes at Ayush's expense.

One bright morning, Ayush is walking to school, his hands full of books. Suddenly, a banana peel flies out of nowhere, landing at his feet. Ayush slips, his books flying everywhere.

ARPIT: *laughing* "You should really watch where you're going, Ayush!"

Ayush looks up to see Arpit, his laughter echoing through the street. Ayush sighs, then grins.

AYUSH: "You know, Arpit, I've always wondered. Do you buy bananas just to throw the peels at me? That's got to be expensive."

Arpit stops laughing, his eyes widening in surprise. Ayush just chuckles, picking up his books.

Later, in the school corridor, Arpit spots Ayush carrying a tray of food for the school charity event. Arpit grins, seeing an opportunity for another 'joke'. He sticks out his foot, tripping Ayush. The tray goes flying, food splattering everywhere.

ARPIT: *laughing* "Whoops! Sorry, Ayush. Guess I'm just too... trippy."

Ayush looks at the mess, then at Arpit. He smiles, then starts laughing.

AYUSH: "You know, Arpit, I think this is a great look for you."

Ayush picks up a handful of whipped cream and splats it onto Arpit's face. The corridor erupts in laughter. Arpit sputters, his eyes wide with shock.

The next day, Ayush is in the school library, studying. Arpit walks in, his eyes scanning the room. He spots Ayush and grins, walking over to his table.

ARPIT: "Hey, Ayush. Got any good books to recommend?"

Ayush looks up, a mischievous glint in his eyes.

AYUSH: "Sure, Arpit. How about 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'? I think you could use some pointers."

Arpit frowns, but Ayush just smiles, going back to his book.

Later, in the school play, Arpit is playing the role of a clown. He's hamming it up, trying to get laughs. Suddenly, a pie flies out of nowhere, hitting him square in the face. The audience roars with laughter.

Arpit looks out, his eyes meeting Ayush's. Ayush grins, giving him a thumbs up. From that day forward, Arpit realizes that laughter is best when it's with someone, not at someone. And Ayush? He's no longer the butt of the joke. He's the one making them.
