### Panel 1  
[Wide shot of the realm of Aeloria, with silver rivers winding through lush, emerald green mountains. Ancient forests stretch as far as the eye can see under a sky tinged with gold from the setting sun.]  

**Narration:** In the far reaches of the realm of Aeloria, where silver rivers carved valleys through emerald mountains and ancient forests whispered secrets to the wind, there stood a kingdom forgotten by time. Once, it was the heart of magic — a place where words shaped reality and dreams breathed life into stone.  

**Narration:** But centuries passed, kingdoms rose and fell, and the songs of Aeloria faded into myths told by firelight.  

### Panel 2  
[Close-up of a faint magical glow in the wind, swirling leaves around it. A whispering, ethereal presence seems to linger in the air.]  

**Narration:** Yet magic does not die — it sleeps, waiting for the echo of a voice brave enough to awaken it.

### Panel 1  
[A small, humble village at the edge of the Greywood. Smoke curls lazily from chimneys, and villagers go about their daily lives under gray skies. Liora, a young girl with wild dark hair and a curious gaze, walks past them. They avoid her, whispering.]  

**Narration:** Liora never knew her parents. She grew up in a small village at the edge of the Greywood, raised by an old healer named Maelen. From the moment she could speak, she heard voices in the wind and saw shapes dance in the flames.  

**Narration:** The villagers called her “moon-touched” and muttered prayers when she passed.  

### Panel 2  
[Inside a modest home dimly lit by firelight. Maelen, an elderly woman with kind but weary eyes, presses a silver pendant engraved with runes into Liora’s hands. Outside, lightning flashes, and rain pours heavily.]  

**Maelen:** When the storm comes for you, child, follow the wind.  

**Narration:** Those were Maelen’s final words.  

### Panel 3  
[A desolate village at dawn. Houses are in ruins, crops submerged in water. Liora, clutching the pendant, stands at the edge of the forest. Her face is streaked with tears, but her gaze is resolute as she looks toward the distant mountains.]  

**Narration:** When dawn broke, the old healer was dead, and the village in ruin. At the forest’s edge, Liora turned her tear-streaked face toward the mountains and stepped into the unknown.

### Panel 1  
[A rugged landscape of jagged mountains and swollen rivers. Liora, wearing a tattered cloak, wades through icy water with determination. Her breath is visible in the cold air.]  

**Narration:** For weeks, Liora wandered. She crossed rivers swollen with melted snow, climbed jagged passes, and slept beneath the cold stars. Hunger clawed at her, but her dreams grew clearer — always the same vision: a tower of obsidian at the heart of a hidden city, and a voice calling her name.  

### Panel 2  
[A dusky forest with purples and grays dominating the scene. Liora crouches near an iron snare holding a wounded white wolf. The wolf's golden eyes meet hers as she reaches out carefully.]  

**Narration:** One evening, as dusk painted the sky in bruised shades of purple, she stumbled upon a wounded wolf trapped in an iron snare. Its fur was white as frost, its eyes a piercing gold.  

**Narration:** Against her fear, she freed the creature.  

### Panel 3  
[Nighttime. Liora sits by a small campfire, her face illuminated by the flames. The wolf lies nearby, its golden eyes glowing in the dark as it watches her.]  

**Narration:** It limped away but returned that night, lying by her fire, guarding her sleep.  

**Narration:** She named him Kael.

### Panel 1  
[Liora and Kael traverse a dense, ancient forest. Shafts of light break through the canopy, illuminating their path. Their bond is clear as they move together, Kael at her side.]  

**Narration:** Together, they traveled deeper into the realm’s forgotten wilds — bound by silence, surviving by instinct. Slowly, Liora learned to trust her visions and the ancient whispers carried by the wind.  

### Panel 2  
[An awe-inspiring view of Valecar, the lost city of the First Mages. Mist clings to its crystal-veined walls, and jagged towers rise into the sky, gleaming like starlight. Liora and Kael stand at the edge of the city, gazing in wonder.]  

**Narration:** Beyond the Mistfall Mountains lay Valecar, the lost city of the First Mages. Hidden by enchantments and guarded by storms, its walls gleamed with veins of crystal, and its towers pierced the sky like needles of starlight.

### Panel 1  
[Liora walks through the empty courtyards of Valecar. Shadows of the past — faint images of people laughing and living — linger like ghosts. The ruins are overgrown with moss and ivy, but there’s a strange warmth in the air.]  

**Narration:** Within its ruins, shadows lingered — memories trapped in stone. She heard laughter echoing in empty courtyards and felt warmth in places long abandoned.  

### Panel 2  
[Liora and Kael stand before the towering Obsidian Spire from her dreams. The spire looms ominously, its surface black and reflective like glass. Kael growls low, sensing danger.]  

**Narration:** At the city’s heart rose the Obsidian Spire from her dreams. At its door, Kael halted, growling low. Something ancient and restless stirred within.

### Panel 1  
[Inside the dark, foreboding chamber at the top of the spire. A pale figure in tattered robes sits on a throne, his eyes black voids that absorb all light. Runes flicker faintly on the walls.]  

**Figure:** Child of storms. You carry the last spark.  

**Narration:** Inside the spire, darkness breathed like a living thing. Runes flickered as she passed, lighting her path.  

### Panel 2  
[The figure rises from the throne, his form drifting like mist. The pendant around Liora’s neck glows, and the air crackles with energy. Kael crouches, ready to pounce.]  

**Figure:** Free me, and I will restore what was lost.  

**Narration:** But Liora saw through the illusion. This was no guardian — but the remnant of a mage corrupted by his own power, bound in the spire by those who feared what he had become.  

### Panel 3  
[Liora raises the glowing pendant as Kael lunges at the figure. Shadows twist and writhe around them, but a brilliant light begins to spill from the pendant, pushing the darkness back.]  

**Narration:** Shadows writhed, but Liora raised the pendant, chanting words that rose unbidden from the depths of her soul.  

**Narration:** Light spilled from her, searing the darkness.

### Panel 1  
[A full-page panel. The first rays of dawn break over Valecar, illuminating the glittering valleys and silver rivers below. Liora stands on the highest tower of the city, the pendant glowing faintly at her chest. Kael sits beside her, his tail wagging gently.]  

**Narration:** When the storm cleared, the spire lay silent and empty. The corruption was gone, consumed by the power Maelen had hidden in the pendant — a seed of pure magic, passed through generations to find her.  

**Narration:** Liora stood at the city’s highest tower as the sun broke the horizon. Valleys glittered with dew, and the rivers gleamed like threads of silver.  

**Narration:** Aeloria’s heart beat once more.

### Panel 1  
[Close-up of Liora smiling as the wind swirls around her. Her expression is one of peace and determination.]  

**Narration:** And in the wind, she heard new voices — not warnings, but greetings.  

**Liora:** I am ready.  

### Panel 2  
[A view of the Obsidian Spire from afar, bathed in golden light. The scene feels alive, as if the realm itself is waking from a long slumber.]  

**Narration:** Legends say that if you stand atop the Obsidian Spire at dawn, you can still hear her laughter mingling with the wind — a reminder that courage, like magic, never truly dies.  

**Narration:** The End.
