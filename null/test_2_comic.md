# The Echoes of Aeloria  

## Prologue  

### Panel 1  
[An expansive view of the realm of Aeloria. Silver rivers thread through emerald mountains, and an ancient forest stretches endlessly under a golden twilight. The sky is vast, with streaks of light breaking through the clouds.]  

**Narration**: In the far reaches of Aeloria, where silver rivers carved valleys through emerald mountains and ancient forests whispered secrets to the wind, there stood a kingdom forgotten by time.  

### Panel 2  
[A weathered book lies open on a wooden table, its pages illuminated by the flickering glow of firelight. The faint outlines of runes are etched into the margins of the page.]  

**Narration**: Once, it was the heart of magic — a place where words shaped reality and dreams breathed life into stone.  

### Panel 3  
[The firelight dims, and the image of a slumbering dragon carved into stone fills the panel. Moss and ivy creep over its form, hinting at centuries of abandonment.]  

**Narration**: But centuries passed, kingdoms rose and fell, and the songs of Aeloria faded into myths told by firelight.  

### Panel 4  
[A dark expanse, broken only by a single glowing light. The faint impression of a voice echoes in the darkness, carrying both hope and foreboding.]  

**Narration**: Yet magic does not die — it sleeps, waiting for the echo of a voice brave enough to awaken it.

### Panel 1  
[A small village nestled at the edge of a dense, shadowy forest. Smoke curls from a few chimneys, and villagers walk hurriedly, casting uneasy glances toward the dark woods.]  

**Narration**: Liora never knew her parents. She grew up in a small village at the edge of the Greywood, raised by an old healer named Maelen.  

### Panel 2  
[Inside a simple cottage, Maelen, an elderly woman with kind but weary eyes, sits by the hearth. Liora, a young girl with wild, dark hair, stares into the flames, her expression distant as faint shapes seem to form within the fire.]  

**Narration**: From the moment she could speak, she heard voices in the wind and saw shapes dance in the flames.  

**Villager 1:** "Moon-touched, that one."  
**Villager 2:** "Pray she never brings the forest's curse."  

### Panel 3  
[A storm rages outside the cottage. Maelen, frail but determined, presses a silver pendant into Liora’s hand. The runes on the pendant glint faintly in the firelight.]  

**Narration**: One autumn night, when thunder prowled the sky and rain drowned the crops, Maelen pressed a pendant into Liora’s hand.  

**Maelen:** "When the storm comes for you, child, follow the wind."

### Panel 1  
[Dawn breaks over the village, revealing devastation. The cottage is in ruins, the healer's body wrapped in a simple shroud. Liora, clutching the pendant, stands at the forest’s edge, her face streaked with tears.]  

**Narration**: When dawn broke, the old healer was dead, and the village in ruin.  

**Liora:** "Goodbye, Maelen."  

### Panel 2  
[Liora steps into the shadowy Greywood, her small figure dwarfed by the towering trees. The pendant glows faintly around her neck, casting a soft light in the darkness.]  

**Narration**: At the forest’s edge, Liora turned her tear-streaked face toward the mountains and stepped into the unknown.

### Panel 1  
[Liora trudges through a snow-fed river, her clothes soaked and her expression weary. The jagged peaks of the Mistfall Mountains loom in the distance.]  

**Narration**: For weeks, Liora wandered. She crossed rivers swollen with melted snow, climbed jagged passes, and slept beneath the cold stars.  

### Panel 2  
[In a clearing at dusk, Liora kneels beside a wounded white wolf caught in an iron snare. The wolf snarls weakly, its golden eyes locked on hers as she reaches out hesitantly.]  

**Narration**: One evening, she stumbled upon a wounded wolf trapped in an iron snare.  

**Liora:** "Easy... I won’t hurt you."  

### Panel 3  
[The wolf limps away into the shadows, leaving Liora alone by her meager fire. Her expression is a mix of relief and sadness as she watches it disappear.]  

**Narration**: Against her fear, she freed the creature.

### Panel 1  
[That night, the wolf returns, lying beside her fire. Its golden eyes glint in the firelight as it watches her. Liora, now more relaxed, offers it a small piece of food.]  

**Narration**: It limped away but returned that night, lying by her fire, guarding her sleep.  

**Liora:** "I think I’ll call you Kael."  

### Panel 2  
[Liora and Kael travel together through dense forests and rocky terrain. Liora leads the way, her gaze determined, while Kael pads silently at her side.]  

**Narration**: Together, they traveled deeper into the realm’s forgotten wilds — bound by silence, surviving by instinct.

### Panel 1  
[The hidden city of Valecar is revealed. Its crystalline walls shimmer through the mist, and its towering spires gleam like starlight piercing the clouds.]  

**Narration**: Beyond the Mistfall Mountains lay Valecar, the lost city of the First Mages.  

### Panel 2  
[Liora walks cautiously through an abandoned courtyard, her footsteps echoing. Kael stands alert by her side, his ears perked.]  

**Narration**: She heard laughter echoing in empty courtyards and felt warmth in places long abandoned to moss and ivy.  

**Liora:** "This place... it’s just like my dreams."

### Panel 1  
[The Obsidian Spire looms before Liora and Kael, its surface smooth and foreboding. The wind howls around them as Kael growls low, sensing danger.]  

**Narration**: At the city’s heart rose the Obsidian Spire from her dreams.  

**Liora:** "This is it."  
**Kael:** "Grrr..."

### Panel 1  
[Inside the spire, runes on the walls flicker to life as Liora walks cautiously forward. The shadows seem to shift and breathe around her.]  

**Narration**: Inside the spire, darkness breathed like a living thing.  

### Panel 2  
[A pale, skeletal figure clad in tattered robes sits on an ornate throne. Its hollow eyes lock onto Liora as it speaks. The pendant at her throat glows faintly.]  

**Figure:** "Child of storms. You carry the last spark."  

**Liora:** "Who... Who are you?"

## Page 8  

### Panel 1  
[The figure rises, its form shifting like mist. Kael lunges at it, fangs bared, while shadows writhe around them. Liora holds the glowing pendant tightly, her face filled with resolve.]  

**Narration**: This was no guardian — but the remnant of a mage corrupted by his own power.  

**Figure:** "Free me, and I will restore what was lost!"  
**Liora:** "No!"  

### Panel 2  
[Liora raises the pendant, chanting words that seem to flow from her soul. A brilliant light bursts forth, consuming the shadows and the figure.]  

**Narration**: Light spilled from her, searing the darkness.

## Page 9  

### Panel 1  
[The spire is silent and empty. Liora stands at its peak, looking out over the realm as the first rays of dawn break the horizon. Kael sits beside her, his golden eyes calm.]  

**Narration**: When the storm cleared, the spire lay silent and empty.  

### Panel 2  
[A breathtaking view of Aeloria awakening. Valleys glitter with dew, rivers gleam like silver threads, and the sunlight bathes the land in warmth.]  

**Narration**: Aeloria’s heart beat once more.  

**Liora:** "I am ready."

## Epilogue  

### Panel 1  
[A distant view of the Obsidian Spire at dawn, its silhouette against the rising sun. The wind carries faint echoes of laughter.]  

**Narration**: Legends say that if you stand atop the Obsidian Spire at dawn, you can still hear her laughter mingling with the wind — a reminder that courage, like magic, never truly dies.
